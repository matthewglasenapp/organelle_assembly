We will be doing our organellar genome assemblies on UCSC's Hummingbird computational cluster. A cluster, or supercomputer, is a group of computers that work together and function as a single system. The advantage of using Hummingbird is that it has much more memory and storage than your own personal computers. We can submit jobs to run on hummingbird and will be notified by email when they complete. We do not have to keep our computer running or monitor the progress. We have create a group folder on hummingbird for our class. The group folder is located at `/hb/groups/bioe137/`.

We interact with Hummingbird via the command line interface using UNIX commands. UNIX is an operating system that includes a collection of built-in tools and commands.

To log in to hummingbird, first open the terminal application (Mac users) or Cygwin (Windows users). We will use the `ssh` command to access Hummingbird. `ssh` stands for secure shell and provides a secure connection between your computer and the Hummingbird server. To login, you will use the following command:  
`ssh <your_cruzid>@hb.ucsc.edu`  
Replace `<your_cruzid>` with your UCSC username in your command. You will be prompted to enter your password. For security measures, you will not be able to see the characters you are entering. Type your password and press return/enter.
